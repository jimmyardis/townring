   TownRing — shared place lookup (browser side)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   One implementation of get_place_info for all four cities.

   Each city's voice.js used to carry its own copy (59 to 92 lines,
   all slightly different), and all four shared the same three bugs:

     1. A place result carried a name but no population, so "what is
        the population of Chapin town?" answered with nothing and the
        model fell back to whatever number was in its system prompt —
        the 96,000 Greater Chapin figure.
     2. The map's own name returned the whole multi-tract area typed
        as "city", so "Chapin" also read as 96,000 rather than the
        town's ~1,800.
     3. Colloquial names people actually use (White Rock, Ballentine,
        Lake Murray) are not census places, so they fell through to
        "couldn't find a place", which sounds like a broken map.

   The population now comes from execution/enrich_places.py, and the
   colloquial names from shared/colloquial.json. Keep this in step
   with get_place_info in the chapin-talkmap-api server, which answers
   the same tool on phone calls.
